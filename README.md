# Pet-Awesome Marketing Email

## Summary

* I was hired to design and build email templates like this marketing email for **Pet-Awesome** Pet Products. 
* I used **html** and **CSS** to complete the marketing email.
* The email template is currently being used for the purposes of connecting with social media influencers in order to create brand marketing relationships
* Some of my earlier work on this project is in a different repository of mine. I moved it to this one to make use of the GitHub Pages domain name
    - **[PetAwesomeEmail Repository](https://github.com/gaberull/PetAwesomeEmail)**
* The email should display in the browser through GitHub Pages here: 
    - **<https://gaberull.github.io>**
