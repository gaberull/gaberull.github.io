## Notes to self

- I had to move the background from the body tag or it wouldn't show up when emailing. Although it worked fine in browser. I put it in the table element that the body element enclosed. 
- it is invalid to provide percentages directly as **img** width or height attribute unless you're using HTML 4.01. Which I am here. 
- Percentages are of the container, not the **img** original attributes (like I do on line 13 and the ones below it)
